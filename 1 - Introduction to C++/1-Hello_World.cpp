    1. In C++, return -1 is often used in functions to indicate an error, 
    failure, or some exceptional condition. 

    2. The #include preprocessor directive in C++ is used to include 
    the contents of a file (usually a header file) into the source code
    at the point where the directive appears. It is typically used to 
    include standard library headers or user-defined headers.

    3.In C++, std is the namespace that contains the standard library 
    features provided by the language. It stands for standard and encapsulates 
    all standard library functions, classes, and objects to avoid name 
    conflicts with user-defined functions or classes.
